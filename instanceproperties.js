const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

// You get the 'length' property automatically
console.log(fruits.length); // 3 (you didn't create this - it was already there!)

// You get the 'constructor' property automatically  
console.log(fruits.constructor); // Points to Array (again, automatic!)
